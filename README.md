# DiaryServlet
A coursework project to fulfill the requirements of the RGU CM4108 Cloud Computing module.

This project has been made to demonstrate my ability to create with a basic API that can access AWS DynamoDB. The back end of DiaryServlet has been created using a Java Servlet.

The functionality of the project is to provide an extremely basic diary system to keep track of events that are happening throughout the day.
